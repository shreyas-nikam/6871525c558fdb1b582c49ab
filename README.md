# QuLab: Operational Risk Simulation and Analysis Application

![QuLab Logo](https://www.quantuniversity.com/assets/img/logo5.jpg)

## üìä Project Overview

**QuLab** is an interactive Streamlit application designed as a lab project to explore fundamental concepts of operational risk management through simulation and visualization. It allows users to generate synthetic operational risk data, apply different residual risk calculation methodologies, and visualize the relationships between various risk factors.

This application is ideal for students, analysts, and professionals looking to understand the interplay between inherent risk, control effectiveness, and residual risk in a hands-on, simulated environment.

## ‚ú® Features

*   **Synthetic Data Generation**:
    *   Generate customizable datasets of operational risk units.
    *   Adjust the number of risk assessment units.
    *   Option to include time-series data (Assessment Cycles) for trend analysis.
    *   Includes various risk attributes like `Inherent_Risk_Rating`, `Control_Effectiveness_Rating`, `Process_Complexity`, and operational metrics.
*   **Robust Data Validation**:
    *   Performs automated checks on generated data for expected columns, data types, primary key uniqueness, and missing values.
    *   Provides instant feedback on data integrity.
*   **Flexible Residual Risk Calculation**:
    *   Calculate `Residual_Risk_Rating` using two distinct methods:
        *   **Basic Method**: An additive approach, where Residual Risk is derived from `Inherent Risk - Control Effectiveness`.
        *   **Weighted Method**: A multiplicative approach, typically `Inherent Risk / Control Effectiveness`.
    *   Dynamic mapping of qualitative risk ratings to numerical scores for calculation.
*   **Interactive Visualizations (Powered by Altair)**:
    *   **Process Complexity vs Residual Risk Scatter Plot**: Explore the relationship between process complexity and the resulting residual risk rating for individual units.
    *   **Trend of Average Residual Risk Rating**: (Conditional) If time-series data is enabled, visualize how the average residual risk evolves over different assessment cycles.
    *   **Aggregated Residual Risk Heatmap**: A powerful visualization showing the distribution of residual risk across different combinations of Inherent Risk and Control Effectiveness.

### Key Concepts Explored:

*   **Inherent Risk**: The level of risk before considering the impact of controls.
*   **Control Effectiveness**: The degree to which controls mitigate inherent risk.
*   **Residual Risk**: The level of risk remaining after considering the impact of controls.

### Formulae:

The basic formula for residual risk calculation is:

$$\text{Residual Risk} = f(\text{Inherent Risk}, \text{Control Effectiveness})$$

where $f$ can be either an additive function ('Basic' method) or a multiplicative/weighted function ('Weighted' method).

**Important Considerations:**

*   The synthetic data generated by this application is for illustrative purposes only and should not be used for actual risk management decisions.
*   The residual risk calculation methods used in this application are simplified examples and may not be appropriate for all situations.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the QuLab application locally.

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.7+
*   `pip` (Python package installer)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository (or download the files):**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/qu-lab.git
    cd qu-lab
    ```
    *(Replace `https://github.com/your-username/qu-lab.git` with the actual repository URL if it exists, or mention to download the provided files into a directory)*

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```

3.  **Activate the virtual environment:**
    *   **On Windows:**
        ```bash
        .\venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
    *   **On macOS/Linux:**
        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

4.  **Install the required dependencies:**
    First, create a `requirements.txt` file in the root directory of your project with the following content:

    ```
    streamlit
    pandas
    numpy
    altair
    ```

    Then, install them:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## üèÉ Usage

1.  **Run the Streamlit application:**
    Ensure your virtual environment is active, then run:
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

2.  **Access the Application:**
    Your default web browser should automatically open to the application's local URL (usually `http://localhost:8501`). If not, navigate to this URL manually.

### Instructions:

1.  **Data Generation and Validation**:
    *   Upon launching, you will be on the "Data Generation and Validation" page.
    *   Use the slider to set the "Number of Risk Units".
    *   Check the "Include Time Series Data" box if you want to enable the trend visualization on the "Visualizations" page.
    *   Observe the generated data preview and the validation results. Successful validation stores the data for subsequent pages.

2.  **Residual Risk Calculation**:
    *   Navigate to the "Residual Risk Calculation" page using the sidebar.
    *   Select your preferred "Residual Risk Calculation Method" ('Basic' or 'Weighted') using the radio buttons.
    *   The application will display a preview of the data including the newly calculated `Residual_Risk_Rating`.

3.  **Visualizations**:
    *   Go to the "Visualizations" page via the sidebar.
    *   Explore the interactive plots showing relationships between different risk factors and the calculated residual risk.
    *   If time-series data was included, you will also see a trend plot of average residual risk over assessment cycles.

Experiment with different input parameters on each page to see how they affect the results and the overall risk profile.
