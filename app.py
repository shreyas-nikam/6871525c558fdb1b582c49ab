In this lab, we explore operational risk assessment using synthetic data. This application allows you to generate risk assessment data, validate it, calculate residual risk based on different methods, and visualize the results. The purpose is to create hands-on experience for managing operational risk, which is vital for maintaining financial stability, ensuring regulatory compliance, and enhancing overall organizational resilience.

$\text{Synthetic Data} = \{ \text{randomly sampled attributes for each unit} \}$

$\text{Data Validation} = \{ \text{Column Presence} \} \cap \{ \text{Data Type Correctness} \} \cap \{ \text{PK Uniqueness} \} \cap \{ \text{No Missing Values} \}$

$\text{Residual Risk} = f(\text{Inherent Risk}, \text{Control Effectiveness})$
